# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

- **Project Objective**: Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by leveraging both Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.

- **Algorithms Utilized**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Applied the Linear Regression algorithm to model the relationship between transaction features and the likelihood of fraud, focusing on predictive accuracy and anomaly detection for continuous variables.
  - **Random Forest**: Employed the Random Forest algorithm to enhance prediction accuracy, utilizing an ensemble of decision trees to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent based on complex, non-linear interactions among transaction attributes.

- **Data Collection & Feature Engineering**: Utilized a labeled dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent transaction records. Performed feature engineering to extract relevant transaction features, including transaction amount, location, time, and user behavior patterns, to improve model performance.

- **Model Training & Validation**: Trained both models on the dataset and validated their performance using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. This ensured optimal model performance and minimized overfitting.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed the model using key evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), to ensure reliable detection of fraudulent transactions.

- **Deployment**: Integrated the trained models into an automated fraud detection system that classifies incoming transactions in real-time, providing fast, actionable insights.

- **Use Cases**: The system is ideal for financial institutions, payment gateways, and e-commerce platforms seeking to mitigate the risk of fraudulent activities.
